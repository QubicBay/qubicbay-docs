# Create NFT

Create an NFT inside a normal collection. In a normal collection, only the collection creator can mint NFTs. The creation fee is paid when creating the collection, so minting an NFT costs 0 Qubic.

## Prerequisites

- You are the creator of the target normal collection
- You are signed in and your wallet is connected

## Steps

1. Click "Create NFT"
2. Fill in NFT details
   - Name and description
   - Media (image/video/audio)
   - Optional attributes/traits and external link
   - Supply (typically 1 for a unique NFT)
3. Confirm the target collection (your normal collection)
4. Review the cost summary
   - Creation cost: 0 Qubic (collection creation fee was already paid when the collection was created)
5. Submit and sign the transaction in your wallet
6. Wait for confirmation. Your NFT will appear in the collection once minted
