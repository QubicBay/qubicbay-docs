# Package

### What are packages?

**Packages** are prepaid bundles of minting slots that creators must purchase in order to launch a new NFT collection on the Marketplace. \
Each slot represents one NFT that can be minted as part of the collection.

### Slots

_To launch a new NFT collection on the QubicBay Marketplace:_

* Creators are required to purchase a minting package corresponding to the number of NFTs in the collection.
* The cost of the package is determined by the total number of NFTs to be minted.

| Number of NFTs   | Package Price (in $CFB, equivalent to USDT) |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1,000 NFTs       | 200 USDT worth of $CFB                      |
| 10,000 NFTs      | 2000 USDT worth of $CFB                     |

### Earning

When creating a new collection, creators have the option to set a royalty fee—up to a maximum of 10%—to be withheld from future resales of the NFTs within that collection. \
This configurable percentage helps support the ongoing work of creators and incentivizes continued engagement with the platform.
