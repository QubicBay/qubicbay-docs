# ❓ FAQ
<details>
  <summary>💰 Are all fees paid in CFB?</summary>

  <!-- Content goes here -->
  <p>There are different types of fees on the QubicBay Marketplace, and the payment method depends on the user's role and activity. A distinction must be made between **creators** and **collectors**:</p>

* **Creators** launching a new NFT collection are required to pay the associated minting package fee **exclusively in $CFB**.
* **Collectors** who wish to mint NFTs from a collection must pay the minting cost **exclusively in $Qubic**.
* **Resale transactions** offer more flexibility:
  * In the case of secondary resale, sellers will only be able to accept Qubic.
  * In the case of auction, sellers will be able to decide whether to accept $CFB or $Qubic.

This fee structure ensures a balanced and sustainable ecosystem for creators, collectors, and shareholders alike.

<summary>💸 Does the 3% fee apply to all sales or only secondary sales?</summary>

<p>The **3% fee applies exclusively to secondary sales** on the QubicBay Marketplace.
This means the fee is charged only when an NFT is resold after its initial minting.
Every time an NFT is traded on the secondary market, this fee is applied to the transaction total.</p>

</details>


<details>
<summary>🧾 Who pays the 3% fee, and in which currency?</summary>

The **3% fee is paid by the seller**, not the buyer.

* If the NFT is sold using **$CFB**, the full 3% is retained by the **Marketplace**.
* If the NFT is sold using **$Qubic**, the 3% is split as follows:
  * **2%** to the Marketplace
  * **1%** to Qubic **shareholders**

This fee structure applies only to **secondary sales** and helps support both platform operations and community stakeholders.

<details>
<summary>🏗️ How is the 2% QBay fee for management and improvements handled?</summary>

The **2% fee allocated to the QubicBay Marketplace**—collected from secondary sales made in Qubic—is **transferred directly from the smart contract to the Marketplace’s admin/development account**.

This process is automatic and does **not require prior approval from shareholders**, ensuring seamless support for platform management, maintenance, and future improvements.

<details>
<summary>🖼️ Is minting single NFTs free?</summary>

**Minting is not free** on the QubicBay Marketplace.
The minimum entry requirement is the purchase of a **minting package** for **200 NFTs**, priced at **$100 worth of $CFB**.

This cost structure reflects the technical limitations of the Qubic blockchain, where on-chain memory is limited and therefore **minting carries resource constraints** not found on other blockchains.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📦 Do I need an IPFS account?</summary>

**No, an IPFS account is not required.**
Creators can **upload their pre-assembled NFT files directly** through the QubicBay platform.

The platform will then **automatically handle the upload to IPFS**, ensuring decentralized and permanent storage of your NFT assets without requiring any manual setup or external tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Is large-scale minting automated?</summary>

Currently, **mass minting (e.g., 10,000 NFTs) is not fully automated** on the QubicBay platform.
Creators are expected to manage **bulk minting manually** or by using **external tools** to prepare and upload their collections. While support for full automation of large-scale NFT generation is planned for future updates, it is **not yet integrated** into the platform.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧩 Will there be a generative tool for building images and metadata, or do creators need to do it manually?</summary>

At this stage, the **QubicBay platform does not provide a built-in generative tool** for assembling images from layers or automatically generating metadata. Creators are responsible for **manually preparing both the images and metadata** for their NFTs before uploading.

There are currently **three types of NFT minting mechanisms** supported on QubicBay:

1. **Drop Mint**
   * NFTs are minted by users from a drop collection created by the creator.
   * Creators upload the full set of pre-generated assets to the Marketplace.
   * During the minting process, users **cannot see the image** before minting—only after they mint, the image is revealed.
   * This is typically used for blind drops or mystery boxes.
2. **Normal Mint**
   * The collection creator mints all NFTs directly.
   * Used when the creator controls the full minting process.
   * Images and metadata must be **fully prepared and uploaded manually**.
3. **Manual Minting for Collections**
   * In both drop and normal mint types, the NFT assets must be **fully assembled by the creator prior to uploading**.
   * **No automatic metadata generation** or image layering tools are available at this time.

> 🔧 Generative tools or automated layer-based builders are planned for future development but are **not currently integrated** into the platform.
